\title{Given a clustering vector and a set of selections assign names to the clusters}
\usage{
getClusterLabelsFromSelection(clustering, selections,
  multiClassCutoff = 0.3, ambiguous.ratio = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{clustering}{a named factor of clusters, where every entry is a cell}

\item{selections}{a pagoda2 selection object}

\item{multiClasscutoff}{percent of cells in any one cluster that can be multiassigned}

\item{ambiguour.ratio}{the ratio of first and second cell numbers for any cluster to produce a valid clustering}
}
\value{
a data.frame with two colums, one for cluster and one for selections, each cluster appears only once
}
\description{
This function will use a set of pagoda2 cell seletcion to identify
the clusters in a a named factor. It is meant to be used to import user defined annotations
that are defined as selections into a more formal categorization of cells that are defined by cluster.
To help with this the function allows a percent of cells to have been classified in the selections into
multiple groups, something which may be the result of the users making wrong selections. The percent of
cells allows to be multiselected in any given group is defined by multiClassCutoff. Furthermore
the method will assign each cluster to a selection only if the most popular cluster to the next most popular
exceed the ambiguous.ratio in terms of cell numbers. If a cluster does not satisfy this condtiion it is not
assigned.
